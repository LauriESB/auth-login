# auth-login

so, I made this repo to make an authentication page and then restructure my @ porkin project.
I tried implementing it in the original project but it gives me an error I just cannot comprehend, let alone solve, so I'll just do the auth page here and implement everything I did again.

guess it was obvious that one should implement authentication before starting to develop an application, but yeah, lesson learned.
