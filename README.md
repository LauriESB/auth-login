# auth-login

so, i made this repo to make an authentication page and then reestructure my @ porkin project.
I tried implementing it in the original project but it gives me an error I just cannot comprehend, let alone solve, so I'll just do the auth page here and implement everything I did again.

guess it was an obvious thing that one should implement authentication before starting to develop an application, but yeah I guess I was just dumb
